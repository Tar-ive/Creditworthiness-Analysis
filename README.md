## Introduction

Credit risk evaluation is a crucial task for financial institutions to determine the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan. This project aims to build a predictive model to assess credit risk using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Give Me Some Credit" dataset from Kaggle. It contains various features about borrowers and their financial status.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tar-ive/Creditworthiness-Analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd credit-risk-evaluation
```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `give_me_credit.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially to see the data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

## Modeling and Evaluation

The notebook includes the following sections:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the data through descriptive statistics and visualizations.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
3. **Modeling**: Building and training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.
